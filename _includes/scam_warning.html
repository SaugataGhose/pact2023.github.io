    A fake hotel reservation service is trying to scam attendees & speakers!
</p>
<p>
    Scam companies, such as Travel Hosting (operations@travelhosting.co.uk), may try to reach out.
    Please ignore the emails.
    Do not reply, click on any links in them, fill out any forms, or provide credit card information.
</p>
<p>
    PACT does not use third-party organizations that reach out to you (online or via telephone) for booking accommodations.
    For your safety and security, reservations at the conference hotel should only be made using the following link:
    <br>
    <a href="https://reservations.travelclick.com/75044?groupID=4029480">https://reservations.travelclick.com/75044?groupID=4029480</a>.
    <br>
    There still are rooms available.
